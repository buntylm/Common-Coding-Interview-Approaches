/*
 Brute force approach
 - Try all posssible solutions and pick the best or valid one.
 - Often end up with O(n2) or O(n3)
 - Not optional solution but
    - Easy to get correct
    - Give a reference to compare optimized solution
 
 
 General recipe
 1. Enumerate all possibilities (loops, recursion, combinations)
 2. Check each possibility against the problem's constraints
 3. Track the best or first valid solution.

/*
 Example 1
 Problem: Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of contiguous subarray.
 
 maxSubarraySumBruteForce([-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]))

 */


/*
 Example 2
 Problem: Given an array and a target, find two numbers that sum to the target.
 
 twoSumBruteForce([2,7,11,15], 9))
