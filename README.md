# Common Coding Interview Approaches
A curated collection of **coding interview problem-solving techniques** with explanations, examples, and Swift implementations.
The goal is to **start from brute force** (baseline correctness) and progressively optimize using common patterns, while tracking personal learning progress.

## 🎯 Purpose
* 📚 **Learn**: Understand the most common coding approaches used in interviews.
* 🛠 **Practice**: Solve problems in Swift (and possibly other languages in the future).
* 🚀 **Optimize**: Move from brute force → efficient solutions step-by-step.
* 🤝 **Share**: Help other developers prepare for technical interviews.

## 🧠 Learning Path
1. Start with **Brute Force** to ensure correctness.
2. Recognize **patterns** that allow optimization.
3. Implement the **optimized version**.
4. Compare complexity and verify results with brute force.
5. Move to the **next approach**.
